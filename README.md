# DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate
### by Coursera and  deeplearning.ai
This is my notes and assignment for the Coursera: Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I completed the [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate]. The specialization program covers Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Relu, Dropout, and more. I built the models of image regconition, housing prices prediction, natural language processing, and more. The assignments are built in Python and in TensorFlow. I created this repositories for the people who are interested in deep learning.

Dependencies:

* Python 3 (or superior)
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Scikit Learn
* Pandas
* Numpy
* MatplotLib


**Course 1: [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/home/welcome)**
This is the first course of the four courses of the [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) 
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning 
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks - Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture.
